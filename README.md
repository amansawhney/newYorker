## We are in the big leagues now âš¾

The New Yorker was in need of a front end developer to take their concepts and turn them into a functional digital experience for a branding deal with Amazon.  A friend, Miranda Mu(aka the best UX person ever), connected me with them.

### What I Delivered 
* A translation of their visions into an experience 
* A UI that fit with their UX

### Project Details
* Tasks: Javascript front end development, Wordpress integrations 
* Company: The New Yorker + Amazon 

## Experience Summary
To promote Amazon's new show, "The Last Tycoon," the experience introduces the premise and each character through a serious of vertically sliding pages leading to a call to action.  It invites the user to explore the show from its quirks to the intense drama.
